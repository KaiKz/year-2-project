Xcode to compile

So sorry for submitted late as my sound files and vedio were too too big

Write-ups folder contains 2 pdf files, one for techinical aspects, incluing a description about the general coding thought development, another pdf contains my research and references

Vedio was not able to be submitted to VLE and Gitbub as it is too big, but it is on Youtube, here is the link: https://youtu.be/SjIaeaZixv0

Please find the data and scr file to compile using openframeworks
